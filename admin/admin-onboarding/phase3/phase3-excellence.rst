Expansion and optimization part 3: Create a center of excellence
*******************************************************************************

After you complete the onboarding phase, the pilot phase, and the expansion and optimization phase, you can maintain your setup by creating internal documentation that tracks the following:

- Internal champion video of the o11y production environment, highlighting important functionality, dashboards and alerts tied to business KPIs including SLOs and SLIs (To learn what SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs are, see :ref:`sli-slo-sla`.)

- Identification of key teams, users, channels, and other contacts for Splunk Observability Cloud, including the Splunk account team and regular cadences like office hours

- Well documented, shared OTel naming convention

Perform iterative updates on your center of excellence quarterly.
