Expansion and optimization part 3: Create a center of excellence
*******************************************************************************

After you complete the onboarding phase, the pilot phase, and the expansion and optimization phase, you can maintain your setup by creating internal documentation that tracks the following:

- Internal champion recorded video of the o11y production environment, highlighting important functionality, dashboards and alerts tied to business KPIs including SLO/SLIs

- Identified key teams, users, and channels /contacts for Splunk O11y (including the Splunk account team and regular o11y cadences like office hours)

- Well documented shared OTEL naming convention within the customer

Perform iterative updates on your Center of Excellence quarterly.
