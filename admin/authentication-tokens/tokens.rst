Use authentication tokens to authenticate Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring API requests, track API usage, and control your use of resources.

Infrastructure Monitoring has two types of tokens:

* :ref:`admin-api-access-tokens` (also known as session tokens). These tokens are valid for a short period.
* :ref:`admin-org-tokens` (also known as org tokens). These tokens are valid for an extended period.
