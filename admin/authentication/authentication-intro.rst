One of the first steps in getting started with Observability Cloud is setting up your organization. In Observability Cloud, an organization, or account, is the highest-level security grouping. For example, other organizations and their users can't access the data in your organization.

To set up your organization, create and carry out a plan for addressing the tasks described in this topic. Many of these tasks require administrator access, and you might need to perform some administrative tasks on a regular basis after your initial setup.
