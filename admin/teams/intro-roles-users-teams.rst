As a Splunk Observability Cloud administrator, use teams to organize users by functional area, then you can connect users in a particular area to the detectors and dashboard groups that they're most interested in. For example, here are examples of some teams based on functional areas:

  * Security: Teams who monitor hardware and software security
  * Hardware operations: Teams who add, replace, or fix computer hardware
  * DevOps: Teams responsible for maintaining system uptime
  * Infrastructure IT: Teams who manage user access to systems

In these areas, each team might monitor specific metrics related to their functional area, or they might monitor a general set of metrics for the specific systems they manage, or both.

For example, your security team might focus on metrics that indicate login failures, because these failures indicate attempts to break into systems. You might also have several DevOps teams, each of which monitors CPU temperature and network response time metrics for the systems they manage.
