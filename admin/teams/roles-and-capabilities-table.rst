Splunk Observability Clouds lets you restrict access to certain features to specific groups of users using role-based access control. You assign roles to users. A role contains a set of capabilities. These capabilities define what actions are available to roles. For example, capabilities determine whether someone with a particular role has capabilities to create detectors or dashboards.
