"In Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring, the term \"resolution\" can refer to"

msgstr ""

#: ../../infrastructure/dpm-retention.rst:16
msgid ""
"When plotting a graph or evaluating an analytical expression, the Splunk "
"Infrastructure Monitoring service first needs to determine the native "
"resolution of the metrics on the chart. The native resolution - denoted "
"by the time interval between successive data points sent to Splunk "
"Infrastructure Monitoring - determines the precision and quality of the "
"chart that you ultimately see."

"In the context of operations monitoring, high resolution or fine data can"
" have an interval as small as one second (1s), while low resolution or "
"coarse data can have intervals as high as five minutes (5m) or more."
msgstr ""

#: ../../infrastructure/dpm-retention.rst:20
msgid ""
"The primary factor in selecting a native resolution is the incoming rate "
"of the data itself. In other words, we measure reporting intervals for "
"each time series and, all things being equal, will use that native "
"resolution for graphs and analytics. If you are sending it in every "
"second, we will try to act on it every second."

"When it renders charts, Observability Cloud defaults to a display "
"resolution based on the time range of the chart. In general, shorter time"
" ranges have a fine resolution, and the chart resolution is more likely "
"to be the same as the native resolution. Conversely, longer time ranges "
"have a coarse resolution, and the chart resolution is more likely to "
"differ from the native resolution. For longer time range charts, "
"Observability Cloud ensures that the displayed points accurately reflect "
