"Suppose you are an online retailer. A meaningful custom event for your "

"users drop off and don't finish a checkout workflow. You might also want "
"to understand where users are stagnating in your application. You can "
"create a custom event to discover which events precipitate an "
"unsuccessful customer journey. Perhaps users are stopped by an error in "
"your checkout workflow, or are unable to enter a promo code. Custom "
"events provide the opportunity for you to see a unique perspective on "
"your data driven by the questions that matter most to you."
