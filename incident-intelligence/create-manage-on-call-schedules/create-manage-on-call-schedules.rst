When an incident occurs, it is important to contact a responder who understands that part of the system architecture to fix the problem. You can accomplish this through scheduling. An on-call schedule consists of a rotating group of responders that are assigned shifts for incident response. Use an on-call schedule as a step in your incident workflows.

Follow these steps to create a schedule. See :ref:`ii-use-schedules` for specific schedule use cases.
