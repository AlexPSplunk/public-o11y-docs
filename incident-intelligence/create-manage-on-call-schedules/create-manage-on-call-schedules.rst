When an incident occurs, it is important to contact a responder who understands that part of the system architecture to fix the problem. You can accomplish this through scheduling. An on-call schedule consists of a rotating group of responders that are assigned shifts for incident response. Use an on-call schedule as a step in your service incident workflows.

Follow these steps to create a schedule. See :ref:`ii-schedule-scenarios` for steps to create specific schedule scenarios.

Now that you've created an on-call schedule, add it to the incident workflow for the relevant incident policy. Responders are not paged until the schedule is included as a step in an incident workflow. To learn how to add schedules to the incident workflow, see :ref:`ii-configure-incident-workflows`.
