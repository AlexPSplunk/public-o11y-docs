On-call schedule scenarios
************************************************************************

.. meta::
   :description: Applied on-call schedule scenarios to help you learn how to create on-call schedules for Incident Intelligence in Splunk Observability Cloud.

Find the scenario that fits your situation to learn how to create your on-call schedule. For basic on-call schedule creation steps see :ref:`ii-create-manage-on-call-schedules`.

Scenario 1: Week-by-week coverage
==========================================================

Week-by-week shifts let you define coverage that is consistent week after week. For example, one responder covers weekends from 5 PM Friday to 8 AM Monday for 4 weeks. Follow these steps to set up this example schedule.

#. In Incident Intelligence, select :guilabel:`Incident Management`.
#. Select the :guilabel:`On-call schedules` tab.
#. Select :guilabel:`Create new schedule`.
#. Select the pencil icon to edit the schedule name. For this example, name the schedule "Heroes team, web application service". Select the checkmark icon to save your schedule name.  
#. (Optional) Add a teams tag if you want to associate your schedule with a team. The teams tag makes finding a schedule in an incident workflow easier. It also sorts the team members at the top of the responder list when adding responders to your schedule shifts. To add a teams tag, enter the team name in the :guilabel:`Teams tag` field and select the team when it appears.
#. Enter a shift name. For this example, enter "Weekend coverage".
#. Select a shift start date.
#. Use the timezone picker to select the timezone for the coverage.
#. Under :guilabel:`Define shift coverage`, select :guilabel:`Week-by-week`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Fridays` at :guilabel:`05:00 PM` in the :guilabel:`Starts on` drop-down lists.
#. Select :guilabel:`Mondays` at :guilabel:`08:00 AM` in the :guilabel:`Ends on` drop-down lists.
#. Under :guilabel:`Customize shift handoff`, select :guilabel:`4` to have the same responder cover the weekend shift for 4 weeks. 
#. Under :guilabel:`Add responders`, add one or more responders to the shift. 
    #. Enter responder names and select them when they appear. 
    #. Drag responders in the list to reorder.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save shift`. 

You now have a schedule with a week-by-week shift that includes coverage for weekends from 5 PM Friday to 8 AM Monday. You can add additional shifts within this schedule to create coverage for other days of the week for this same team and environmental component. See :ref:`scenario-three` for an example of a multi-shift schedule. 

Scenario 2: Day-by-day coverage
=====================================================

Day-by-day shifts let you define coverage for specific days of the week. For example, one responder covers Monday-Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM for 1 week. Follow these steps to set up this example.

#. In Incident Intelligence, select :guilabel:`Incident Management`.
#. Select the :guilabel:`On-call schedules` tab.
#. Select :guilabel:`Create new schedule`.
#. Select the pencil icon to edit the schedule name. For this example, name the schedule "Heroes team, web application service". Select the checkmark icon to save your schedule name. 
#. (Optional) Add a teams tag if you want to associate your schedule with a team. The teams tag makes finding a schedule in an incident workflow easier. It also sorts the team members at the top of the responder list when adding responders to your schedule shifts. To add a teams tag, enter the team name in the :guilabel:`Teams tag` field and select the team when it appears. 
#. Enter a shift name. For this example, enter "Weekday coverage, business hours".
#. Select a shift start date.
#. Use the timezone picker to select the timezone for the coverage.
#. Under :guilabel:`Define shift coverage`, select :guilabel:`Day-by-day`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Monday` through :guilabel:`Friday`.
#. Select :guilabel:`08:00 AM` in the :guilabel:`Daily start time` drop-down list.
#. Select :guilabel:`05:00 PM` in the :guilabel:`Daily end time` drop-down list. You need to uncheck :guilabel:`Create 24 hr shifts` to select a daily end time.
#. Under :guilabel:`Customize shift handoff`, select :guilabel:`5`, to have the same responder cover the entire week. 
#. Under :guilabel:`Add responders`, add one or more responders to the shift. 
    #. Enter responder names and select them when they appear. 
    #. Drag responders in the list to reorder.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save shift`. 

You now have a schedule with a day-by-day shift that includes coverage for business hours Monday-Friday. You can add additional shifts within this schedule to create coverage for other days of the week for this same team and environmental component. For an example of a multi-shift schedule, see the next scenario.

.. _scenario-three:

Scenario 3: Business hours and nights-and-weekend rotation for the web application service
==========================================================================================================

Coverage needs:

- You need coverage for your web application service for business hours Monday through Friday of each week, with one responder on the team being on call for a whole week.
- You also need coverage for your web application service for nights and weekends. Night coverage is 5 PM to 8 AM Monday through Friday. Weekend coverage is one responder who is on call from Friday at 5 PM to Monday at 9 AM.
- Finally, you need one responder on call 24x7 as secondary coverage for one week Monday through Sunday.

For these coverage needs, you need to create two schedules, one for the primary coverage that includes three shifts: one for business hours, a second for nights coverage, and a third for weekends. The second schedule is your schedule for secondary coverage. Finally, you need to add these schedules to two steps in the incident workflow for the web application service. Follow these steps to create schedules for these coverage needs. 

Create a schedule for primary coverage
----------------------------------------

Follow these steps to create your primary schedule:

#. In Incident Intelligence, select :guilabel:`Incident Management`.

#. Select the pencil icon to edit the schedule name. For this example, name the schedule "Heroes team, web application, service primary". Select the checkmark icon to save your schedule name.  
#. (Optional) Add a teams tag if you want to associate your schedule with a team. The teams tag makes finding a schedule in an incident workflow easier. It also sorts the team members at the top of the responder list when adding responders to your schedule shifts. To add a teams tag, enter the team name in the :guilabel:`Teams tag` field and select the team when it appears.

Create a business-hours shift
-------------------------------

Follow these steps to create a day-by-day shift for business hours coverage:

#. Select :guilabel:`Add new shift`
#. Enter a shift name. For this example, enter "Business hours".
#. Select a Monday for your shift start date to correctly configure this shift for Monday-Friday.
#. Use the timezone picker to select the timezone for the coverage.
#. Under :guilabel:`Define shift coverage`, select :guilabel:`Day-by-day`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Monday` through :guilabel:`Friday`.
#. Select :guilabel:`08:00 AM` in the :guilabel:`Daily start time` drop-down list.
#. Select :guilabel:`05:00 PM` in the :guilabel:`Daily end time` drop-down list. You need to uncheck :guilabel:`Create 24 hr shifts` to select a daily end time.
#. Under :guilabel:`Customize shift handoff`, select :guilabel:`5` to have the same responder cover the entire week. 
#. Under :guilabel:`Add responders`, add one or more responders to the shift. The first responder you add to the shift is on-call on the start date you selected. 
    #. Enter responder names and select them when they appear. 
    #. Drag responders in the list to reorder.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save shift`. 

Create a weeknights shift
------------------------------------

#. Use the timezone picker to select the timezone for the coverage.
#. Under :guilabel:`Define shift coverage`, select :guilabel:`Day-by-day`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Monday` through :guilabel:`Friday`.
#. Select :guilabel:`05:00 PM` in the :guilabel:`Daily start time` drop-down list.
#. Select :guilabel:`08:00 AM` in the :guilabel:`Daily end time` drop-down list. You need to uncheck :guilabel:`Create 24 hr shifts` to select a daily end time.
#. Under :guilabel:`Customize shift handoff`, select :guilabel:`5` to have the same responder cover the entire week. 
#. Under :guilabel:`Add responders`, add one or more responders to the shift. The first responder you add to the shift is on-call on the start date you selected in step 2. If there is an overlap in the responders across your shifts, use the schedule preview to ensure each responder has enough time off between their on-call shifts. 
    #. Enter responder names and select them when they appear. 
    #. Drag responders in the list to reorder.
#. Select :guilabel:`Save shift`. 

Create a weekends shift
------------------------------------

Follow these steps to create a week-by-week shift for weekend coverage:

#. Enter a shift name. For this example, enter "Weekends".
