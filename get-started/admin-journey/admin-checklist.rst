   :description: Overview of the Observability Cloud admin tasks and links to the documentation.

Many of companies go through a similar journey when they first start to use the Splunk Observability Cloud. This document is meant to be a guide to capture the common journey and points to consider as you set up your org and onboard uers. 

To set up your organization, you should create and carry out a plan for addressing the tasks described in this topic. Many of these tasks require administrator access, and you might need to perform some administrative tasks on a regular basis after your initial setup.

..note:: Not all tasks may apply to your organization or environment. Use these checklists as a starting point: build out what makes sense and discard the items that don't apply.

Overview
============

In general, we recommend starting small with a pilot group. Starting with one or two pilot teams makes it easier to gather information and requirements, build out a framework to meet those needs, and validate your work. Once you've fine-tuned the teams, metrics, dashboards, and so on for your pilot groups, you can then confidently begin expanding the scope of adoption across your organization.

The duration of each segment will depend heavily on the availability and technical skill set of the people involved in this journey. Some segments might go much faster in your organization depending on the experience and skills available.

The first onboarding phase generally consists of a number of activities aimed at connecting Splunk Observability Cloud to the existing software framework that already exists in your environment. The second part sets up standards and procedures for the actual end users, like development teams and site reliability engineers, for example.

This document details the adoption journey to help Developers and SREs get the most value out of the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring and Splunk Application Performance Monitoring products.
