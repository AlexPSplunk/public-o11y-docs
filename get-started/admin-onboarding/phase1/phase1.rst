Your goal in the onboarding phase is to understand the platform and make sure your onboarding team is ready to support the rest of the organization. During this phase, your main focus is to make sure you and any other staff that will be responsible for administering Splunk Observability Cloud are ready to manage Splunk Observability Cloud within your organization. This is defined into 3 high-level sets of activities:

#. :ref:`Configure your user and team administration<phase1-team-user-admin>`.
#. :ref:`Design your architecture and get data in<phase1-arch-gdi>`.
#. :ref:`Plan your rollout<phase1-rollout-plan>`.
