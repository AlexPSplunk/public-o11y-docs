Overview of Splunk Observability Cloud
===========================================================

Splunk Observability Cloud is a modern SaaS solution for infrastructure monitoring, custom metrics, APM (application performance monitoring), RUM (real user monitoring), synthetic monitoring, always-on profiling, and incident intelligence. Observability Cloud also provides a direct integration with Splunk Cloud Platform logs through LogObserver Connect. Through full-fidelity monitoring and troubleshooting across infrastructure, applications, and user interfaces, in real time and at any scale, Observability Cloud helps you keep your services reliable, deliver great customer experiences, and innovate faster.

Splunk Observability Cloud allows you to quickly and intelligently respond to outages and identify root causes, while also giving you the data-driven guidance you need to optimize performance and productivity going forward. You can select from over 100 supported open standards-based integrations with common data sources to get data from your on-premises and cloud infrastructure, applications and services, and user interfaces into Observability Cloud. When you send data from each layer of your full-stack environment to Observability Cloud, it transforms raw metrics, traces, and logs into actionable insights in the form of dashboards, visualizations, alerts, and more.

Your subscription to the Splunk Observability Cloud service can be host-based or usage-based. By exception, you might be on an ingest-based subscription that is sized for data volume ingested. For more information, see Subscription types. Unless otherwise noted, Splunk manages and updates the Splunk Observability Cloud service uniformly, so all customers of Splunk Observability Cloud receive the most current features and functionality.
