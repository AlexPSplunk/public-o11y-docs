MTS creations per minute per product limit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   * :strong:`Default limit value`: 6,000 or determined by your subscription.
   * :strong:`Notes`: Maximum number of MTS you can create per minute for each product. For example, if you create 5,500 MTS in the first minute for Infrastructure Monitoring, you can still create 5,500 more in the next minute. You can also create another 6,000 more MTS in the first minute for each other product you use.
