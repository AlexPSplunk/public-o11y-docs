The Browser RUM agent instruments all front-end experiences that run in modern browsers, regardless of the JavaScript library or framework you use.

The Browser RUM agent supports the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Internet Explorer 11, which requires the ``splunk-otel-web-legacy.js`` version of the Browser RUM agent

All your pages, assets, and requests must be securely loaded over the HTTPS protocol.

.. note:: Splunk APM is not required to instrument Splunk RUM for Browser.
