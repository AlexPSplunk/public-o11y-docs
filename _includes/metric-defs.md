Notes:

- Read about [metric types](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/metrics-and-metadata/metric-types.html#nav-Metric-types) in Observability Cloud.
- Default metrics are those metrics supported by default in Observability Cloud, such as host, container, or bundled metrics. Custom metrics are ad-hoc metrics and subject to charges. See more about [metric categories](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/metrics-and-metadata/metrics.html#metric-category).
