   :description: Learn about options for detectors and alerts in Splunk APM. 

You can use detectors to dynamically monitor request rate, error rate, and latency in the services you are tracing with Splunk APM. APM detectors use built-in algorithms to generate alerts about sudden spikes and historical anomalies in your APM metrics or Business Workflows. AutoDetect detectors are also available.

You can set up an APM detector from the detector menu on any chart with APM metrics, to get alerted about the changes in data that matter most to you.
