    :description: This Splunk APM use case describes how to monitor for service latency.

Kai, a site reliability engineer at the fictitious Buttercup Games, wants to monitor a latency issue affecting a critical checkout workflow for the :strong:`cartservice` service and :strong:`/getcart` endpoint for a specific set of customers who most frequently have problems with the service. By generating a Monitoring MetricSet with ``version_id`` as a custom dimension and filtering it to the customers affected by the issue, Kai can set up a detector to monitor service and endpoint latency by customer. Kai can also create charts and dashboards that show service and endpoint latency for specific customers over time.


Generate a Monitoring MetricSet and filter by span tag
====================================================================================
To generate Monitoring MetricSets by customer:

1. Kai indexes a span tag to identify each customer: ``version_id``. See :ref:`apm-index-span-tags` for the steps Kai takes to generate a custom MMS.

2. Kai generates a Monitoring MetricSet using ``version_id`` as a dimension. See :ref:`cmms` for the steps Kai takes to generate a custom MMS.

3. Kai sets the scope of the Monitoring MetricSet to the :strong:`cartservice` service, and filters on the tag values for ``version_id`` that represent the specific list of customers Kai wants to investigate. 

This image shows a sample Monitoring MetricSet configuration with the service selected as :strong:`cartservice`, endpoint as :strong:`/getcart` and filtering by tag values for ``version_id``:

Create service latency detectors to track metrics 
====================================================================================

Kai can leverage the custom dimensionalized Monitoring MetricSet Kai created to monitor the performance of this critical checkout workflow in the :strong:`cartservice` service. To do this, Kai creates a detector using the same custom indexed tag, ``version_id``, to track error rates associated with the checkout workflow.


1. There are two ways for Kai to navigate to the Detector Creation page to create a detector using their custom Monitoring MetricSet:
    a. From the left navigation panel, select: :strong:`Alerts & Detectors` > :strong:`New Detector`.
    b. From any APM page, select the plus sign :strong:`( + )` on the top bar and select :strong:`Detector` from the drop-down list . 


2. Kai follows the guided Detector Creation flow to create their detector based on the error rate in the service :strong:`cartservice:GetCart`, filtered to the custom dimension of ``version_id``.

3. Kai can use the Metric Finder to find additional information on the metrics and metadata for their system. For more, see :ref:`Metric Finder and Metadata Catalog<metrics-finder-and-metadata-catalog>`. Apply :strong:`sf_dimensionalized:true` as a :strong:`Filter` to see related metrics as shown in the image below.

Set up charts, dashboards, and alerts for custom dimensions
==================================================================
Kai can also create charts and dashboards that leverage the custom dimensions Kai created.

Kai navigates to the built-in APM service endpoint dashboard for :strong:`cartservice:GetCart` using the following steps:

#. From the :strong:`APM` landing page, select the :guilabel:`Dashboards` icon in the left navigation bar.

#. Search :strong:`APM` in the search bar.

#. Under :strong:`APM Services` in the :strong:`Built-in Dashboard Groups` section, click :strong:`Service Endpoint`.

#. Select the relevant environment, then select ``cartservice`` as the :strong:`Service`, ``GetCart`` as the Endpoint, and apply :strong:`sf_dimensionalized:true` as a :strong:`Filter`.

5. To see the custom dimensions Kai created, Kai applies the filter :strong:`sf_dimensionalized:true` in the filter bar while creating their dashboard, as the following image illustrates:

Summary
==================================================================

Kai created a Monitoring MetricSet with a custom dimension to track a checkout workflow for a subset of customers. To learn more about Monitoring MetricSets, see :ref:`cmms`.
