<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the SNMP agent monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the SNMP agent monitor type using the Smart Agent Receiver.

Use this monitor to collect metrics from SNMP agents.

This integration is available for Kubernetes, Windows, and Linux.

```{note}
This monitor doesn't support MIB lookups`.
```

### Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```{note}
Provide an SNMP monitor entry in your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.
```

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/snmp:
    type: telegraf/snmp
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/snmp` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/snmp]
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
  - type: telegraf/snmp
    ...  # Additional config
```

The following is a sample Smart Agent monitor configuration:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: telegraf/snmp
   agents:
     - "127.0.0.1:161"
   version: 2
   community: "public"
   fields:
     - name: "uptime"
       oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0"
```

The following is a sample Smart Agent monitor configuration using a discovery rule:

```yaml
monitors:
 - type: telegraf/snmp
   discoveryRule: container_name =~ "snmp" && port == 161
   version: 2
   community: "public"
   fields:
     - name: "uptime"
       oid: ".1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0"
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the SNMP agent monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | No | `string` | Host name or IP address of the SNMP agent. Host and port are concatenated and appended to the list of SNMP agents to connect to. |
| `port` | No | `integer` | Port of the SNMP agent host. Port and Host are concatenated and appended to the list of SNMP agents to connect to. The default value is `0`. |
| `agents` | No | `list of strings` | List of SNMP agent address and ports to query for information. For example, `0.0.0.0:5555`. If an address is supplied without a port, the default port is `161`. |
| `retries` | No | `integer` | Number of retries. The default value is `0`. |

| `engineBoots` | No | `uint32` | The SNMP v3 engine boots. The default value is `0`. |
| `engineTime` | No | `uint32` | The SNMP v3 engine time. The default value is `0`. |
| `name` | No | `string` | The top-level measurement name. |
| `fields` | No | `list of objects (see below)` | The top-level SNMP fields. |
| `tables` | No | `list of objects (see below)` | SNMP Tables. |

The nested `fields` configuration object has the following fields:
