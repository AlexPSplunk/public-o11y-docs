   :description: Use automatic instrumentation to send traces to Splunk Application Performance Monitoring (APM) without altering your code.

Splunk OpenTelemetry Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation for Java automatically instruments supported Java libraries in running applications to capture distributed traces. The Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector receives the distributed traces and forwards them to Splunk Application Performance Monitoring (APM) in Splunk Observability Cloud.

Splunk OpenTelemetry Zero Configuration Auto Instrumentation for Java provides the following benefits:

- You don't need to configure or manually instrument your applications before deployment if your Java applications use any of the supported libraries.
- You can start streaming traces and monitor distributed applications with Splunk APM in minutes.

To enable automatic instrumentation, install the ``splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation`` package. After installing the package, you must start or restart any Java applications that you want to instrument.

.. _prerequisites:

Prerequisites
===========================

- Automatic instrumentation is only available for applications using one or more of the :ref:`supported-java-libraries`. If your application is not currently supported, you can :ref:`java-manual-instrumentation` to generate trace data.

- :ref:`java-requirements`.

- Your Splunk Observability Cloud realm and access token.

   - To get an access token, see :ref:`admin-api-access-tokens`.

   - To find the realm name of your account, open the navigation menu in Observability Cloud. Select :menuselection:`Settings`, and then select your username. The realm name appears in the :guilabel:`Organizations` section.


.. _install-the-package:

Install the package
=========================================================

You can install the ``splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation`` package in two ways:

- Install using the Collector installer script
- Install using Debian or RPM packages

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Install using the Collector installer script

      To install the package, run the Collector installer script with the ``--with-instrumentation`` option. The installer script will install the Collector and the Java agent from the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Java. The Java agent is then loaded automatically when a Java application starts on the local machine.

      Run the installer script with the ``--with-instrumentation`` option, as shown in the following example. Replace  ``<SPLUNK_REALM>`` and ``<SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN>`` with your Observability Cloud realm and token, respectively.

      .. code-block:: bash

         curl -sSL https://dl.signalfx.com/splunk-otel-collector.sh > /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh && \
         sudo sh /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh --with-instrumentation --realm <SPLUNK_REALM> -- <SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN>

      To automatically define the optional ``deployment.environment`` resource attribute at installation time, run the installer script with the ``--deployment-environment <VALUE>`` option. Replace ``<VALUE>`` with the desired attribute value, for example, ``prod``, as shown in the following example:

      .. code-block:: bash

         curl -sSL https://dl.signalfx.com/splunk-otel-collector.sh > /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh && \
         sudo sh /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh --with-instrumentation --deployment-environment prod --realm <SPLUNK_REALM> -- <SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN>

      
      Next, :ref:`verify-install` and :ref:`start-restart-java-apps`. 


   .. tab::  Install using Debian or RPM packages

      .. note:: You must first install the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector using the :ref:`linux-packages`.

      After installing the Collector, follow these steps to install the package using the Debian or RPM repositories with ``root`` privileges:

      1. You can either download the ``splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation`` package directly from the :new-page:`GitHub Releases page <https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases>` or add the Splunk repository to the package repositories on your Linux host. See :new-page:`Debian or RPM package repositories <https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/install-linux.html#debian-or-rpm-packages>` for instructions on how to configure your package repository.

      2. Run the following commands to install the package. Replace ``<path to splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation deb/rpm>`` with the local path to the downloaded package.

         .. tabs::

            .. code-tab:: bash Debian
               
               sudo dpkg -i <path to splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation deb>
               
            .. code-tab:: bash RPM
               
               sudo rpm -ivh <path to splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation rpm>

      3. Edit the ``/etc/otel/collector/splunk-otel-collector.conf`` file to set the ``SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN`` and ``SPLUNK_REALM`` variables to the values you got earlier. If the file does not exist, use the provided sample at ``/etc/otel/collector/splunk-otel-collector.conf.example`` as a starting point.

         .. code-block:: bash

            SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access_token>
            SPLUNK_REALM=<realm>

      4. Start the collector service:

         .. code-block:: bash

            sudo systemctl start splunk-otel-collector


      5. :ref:`verify-install`.
      6. :ref:`start-restart-java-apps`.


.. _verify-install:

Ensure the service is running
--------------------------------------------------------

After a successful installation, run the following command to ensure the ``splunk-otel-collector`` service is running:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl status splunk-otel-collector

If the service is not running, start or restart it with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo systemctl restart splunk-otel-collector

If the service fails to start, check that the ``SPLUNK_REALM`` and ``SPLUNK_ACCESS_TOKEN`` in ``/etc/otel/collector/splunk-otel-collector.conf`` are correct. You can also view the service's logs with this command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo journalctl -u splunk-otel-collector


.. _start-restart-java-apps:

Start your applications
-----------------------------------

You are now ready to start sending traces to Splunk APM. For auto instrumentation to take effect, you must manually start or restart any Java applications on the host where you installed the package. This is true after installing the auto instrumentation package for the first time and whenever you make any changes to the configuration file. 

Once your applications are running, you can :ref:`verify-apm-data`. You an also :ref:`configure-the-script`. 

.. _configure-the-script:

Optionally configure the package
====================================

Installing the package installs the following artifacts:

- The shared instrumentation library at ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/libsplunk.so```
- The configuration file at ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/instrumentation.conf`` 
- The :new-page:`Java Instrumentation Agent <https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-java>` at ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/splunk-otel-javaagent.jar``

You can customize the package by setting parameters in the configuration file.

By default, the configuration file only specifies one parameter, ``java_agent_jar``, which points to the path of the installed Java Instrumentation Agent.

The following is a sample of the default configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

   java_agent_jar=/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/splunk-otel-javaagent.jar

The :ref:`supported-parameters` section discusses additional parameters.

.. _supported-parameters:

Supported parameters
---------------------------------------------

The following table shows the supported parameters for the ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/instrumentation.conf`` file:

.. list-table::       
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 60 20
   :width: 100%
   
   * - Parameter
     - Description
     - Required
   * - ``java_agent_jar``
     - The full path to the JAR file provided by the installer.
     -  Yes
   * - ``service_name``
     - An optional parameter that specifies a unique identifier for a particular host. If you set this parameter, all instrumented Java applications on the host have their service name set using the  ``OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`` environment variable. If this parameter is not set, the shared object assigns a generated name. 
     - No
   * - ``resource_attributes`` 
     - Contains a list of name-value pairs, separated by ``=s``, that the shared object sets to the ``RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`` environment variable. The ``RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`` environment variable is then picked up by the Java instrumentation JAR file. The installer script sets this to something like ``resource_attributes=deployment.environment=test``, which defines the deployment environment.
     - No  


Keep the following information in mind after the installation:

-  Whenever you change the configuration file, you must manually start or restart any Java applications on the host where you installed the package.

- If you installed the package with the installer script and specified the ``--deployment-environment VALUE`` when you ran the script, the ``deployment.environment=VALUE`` resource attribute is automatically added to the configuration file.

- The ``/etc/ld.so.preload`` file is automatically created or updated with the default path to the installed instrumentation library. If necessary, custom library paths can be manually added to this file.


.. _upgrade-the-package:

Upgrade the package
==========================

You can upgrade the package in two ways:

- :ref:`upgrade-with-script`
- :ref:`upgrade-manually`

.. _upgrade-with-script:

Upgrade using the package repository
---------------------------------------------

If you installed the package using the installer script, or if you configured the Debian or RPM package repositories manually, run the following commands according to your platform. Upgrading the package requires ``root`` privileges. 

Debian
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get --only-upgrade splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation

You might see a prompt to keep or overwrite the configuration file at ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/instrumentation.conf``. If you choose to overwrite, the configuration file reverts to the default file provided by the upgraded package.

RPM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the RPM package management system, run the following commands:

yum
##############################

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo yum upgrade splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation

dnf
###################

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo dnf upgrade splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation

zypper
################

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo zypper refresh
   sudo zypper update splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation

After you've upgraded the packages, manually start or restart the Java applications on the host for the changes to take effect.

.. _upgrade-manually:

Upgrade using Debian or RPM packages
---------------------------------------------

To manually upgrade the package:

1. Download the ``splunk-auto-auto-instrumentation`` Debian or RPM package for the target system from the :new-page:`GitHub Releases page <https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases>`.

2. Run the following commands to install the package. Replace ``<path to splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation deb/rpm>`` with the local path to the downloaded package:

   .. tabs::

      .. code-tab:: bash Debian
      
         sudo dpkg -i <path to splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation deb>
      
      .. code-tab:: bash RPM
      
         sudo rpm -Uvh <path to splunk-otel-auto-instrumentation rpm>

After upgrading the Debian package, you might see a prompt to keep or overwrite the configuration file at ``/usr/lib/splunk-instrumentation/instrumentation.conf``. If you choose to overwrite, the configuration file reverts to the default file provided by the upgraded package.

You can also upgrade using the same package repositories as the Collector. See :new-page:`Debian or RPM packages <https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/install-linux.html#debian-or-rpm-packages>` for more information.

Disable automatic instrumentation
=========================================

Use one of the following options to disable automatic instrumentation:

- Uninstall the package by running the following command:

  .. code-block:: bash
   
     curl -sSL https://dl.signalfx.com/splunk-otel-collector.sh > /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh && \
     sudo sh /tmp/splunk-otel-collector.sh --uninstall
  
  See :ref:`otel-linux-uninstall-otel-and-tdagent` for more information on the files deleted by the uninstall.

- Set ``DISABLE_SPLUNK_AUTOINSTRUMENTATION`` to any nonempty value other than ``false``, ``FALSE``, or ``0``.

- Set the ``JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS`` environment variable to some value that you want the JVM to pick up.

- Delete or move the ``instrumentation.conf`` configuration file.
