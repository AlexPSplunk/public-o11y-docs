With a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration in Splunk Observability Cloud, you can track your Google Cloud Monitoring metrics and monitor your GCP services in one place using the navigator in Stackdriver-powered mode and built-in dashboards. For the list of the GCP services available in Observability Cloud, see :ref:`our supported integrations <gcp-integrations>`. 

To configure a GCP integration with Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring, check the prerequisites and follow the instructions on this document. You can also :ref:`use the API <gcp-api>` to connect to GCP.

You must be an administrator of your Splunk Observability Cloud organization to create a GCP connection.

.. note:: 

   Observability Cloud supports all GCP regions.

      <h2>Select a role for your GCP service account<a name="gcp-one" class="headerlink" href="#gcp-one" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
   </embed>

* If you want to use the :strong:`Project Viewer` role, skip to :ref:`Configure GCP <gcp-two>`. Choosing this role ensures that any functionality update implemented in Infrastructure Monitoring doesn't require changes to your GCP setup.
* If you want to use a role with more restrictive permissions than those available to Project Viewer, make sure your selected role has sufficient permissions to connect to Infrastructure Monitoring. If your GCP service account role has insufficient permissions, you'll get an error message when trying to connect to Infrastructure Monitoring. Review and enable any missing permissions, or change the role to Project Viewer.

The following table specifies the permissions required for GCP integrations.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   *  - :strong:`Permission`
      - :strong:`Required?`

   *  - ``monitoring.timeSeries.list``
      - Yes

   *  - ``resourcemanager.projects.get``
      - Yes, if you want to sync project metadata (such as labels), or if you need to obtain metrics from monitored projects of a scoping project  

   *  - ``serviceusage.services.use``
      - Yes, if you want to enable the use of a quota from the project where metrics are stored

   *  - ``spanner.instances.list``

   </embed>

To configure your GCP service, follow these steps:

#. In a new window or tab, go to the Google Cloud Platform website, and log into your GCP account.
#. Open the GCP web console, and select a project you want to monitor.
#. From the sidebar, select :menuselection:`IAM & admin > Service Accounts`.
#. Go to :guilabel:`Create Service Account` at the top of the screen, and complete the following fields:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 40 60

      *  - :strong:`Field`
         - :strong:`Description`

      *  - Service account name
         - Enter ``Splunk``.

      *  - Service account ID
         - This field autofills after you enter ``Splunk`` for Service account name.

      *  - Service account description
         - Enter the description for your service account.

#. Select :guilabel:`CREATE`.
#. (Optional) Select a role to grant this Service account access to the selected project, then select :guilabel:`CONTINUE`.
#. Enable Key type :guilabel:`JSON`, and select :guilabel:`CREATE`. A new service account key JSON file is then downloaded to your computer.
#. In a new window or tab, go to :new-page:`Cloud Resource Manager API <https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com?pli=1>`, and enable the Cloud Resource Manager API. You need to enable this API so Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring can use it to validate permissions on the service account keys.

      <h3>Configure multiple GCP projects<a name="gcp-projects" class="headerlink" href="#gcp-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
   </embed>

To monitor multiple GCP projects with the integration you have two options: 

* Repeat the steps described in this section for each one of the projects. 

* Follow the instructions in GCP's :new-page:`Overview of viewing metrics for multiple projects <https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/settings>` to attach monitored projects to the one you've already configured.

      <h2>Start the integration<a name="gcp-three" class="headerlink" href="#gcp-three" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
   </embed>

By default, all available services are monitored, and any new services added later are also monitored. When you set integration parameters, you can choose to import metrics from a subset of the available services.

#. Log in to Splunk Observability Cloud. 
#. Open the :new-page:`Google Cloud Platform guided setup <https://login.signalfx.com/#/integrations/gcp>`. Optionally, you can navigate to the guided setup on your own:

   #. In the left navigation menu, select :menuselection:`Data Management`, then select :guilabel:`+ Add Integration` to open the :strong:`Integrate Your Data` page.

   #. In the integration filter menu, select :guilabel:`By Use Case`, and select the :guilabel:`Monitor Infrastructure` use case.

   #. In the :guilabel:`Cloud Integrations` section, select the :guilabel:`Google Cloud Platform` tile to open the Google Cloud Platform guided setup.

   #. Go to :guilabel:`New Integration`.

#. Enter a name for this GCP integration, then :guilabel:`Add Project`. 
#. Next, select :guilabel:`Import Service Account Key`, and select one or more of the JSON key files that you downloaded from GCP in :ref:`Configure GCP <gcp-two>`.
#. Select :guilabel:`Open`. You can then see the project IDs corresponding to the service account keys you selected.
#. To import :ref:`metrics <gcp-metrics>` from only some of the available services, follow these steps:

   - Go to :guilabel:`All Services` to display a list of the services you can monitor.
   - Select the services you want to monitor, and then :guilabel:`Apply`.

#.  Select the rate (in seconds) at which you want Splunk Observability Cloud to poll GCP for metric data, with 1 minute as the minimum unit, and 10 minutes as the maximum unit. For example, a value of 300 polls metrics once every 5 minutes. 
#. Optional: 

   - List any additional GCP service domain names that you want to monitor, using commas to separate domain names in the :strong:`Custom Metric Type Domains` field. For examples of custom metric type domain syntax, see :new-page:`Custom metric type domain examples <https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/integrations/gcp_integration_overview#Custom-metric-type-domain-examples>` in the Splunk developer documentation.

   - If you select Compute Engine as one of the services to monitor, you can enter a comma-separated list of Compute Engine Instance metadata keys to send as properties. These metadata keys are sent as properties named ``gcp_metadata_<metadata-key>`` in the :ref:`gce-metrics` table. 

   - Select :strong:`Use quota from the project where metrics are stored` to use a quota from the project where metrics are stored. The service account provided for the project needs either the ``serviceusage.services.use`` permission, or the `Service Usage Consumer` role.

Your GCP integration is now complete.

- Read more about the :ref:`provided GCP metrics <gcp-metrics>`.
- Learn how to :ref:`ingest GCP logs <gcp-logs>`.

.. note:: Splunk is not responsible for data availability, and it can take up to several minutes (or longer, depending on your configuration) from the time you connect until you start seeing valid data from your account.
