<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Couchbase monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the Couchbase server monitor with the SignalFx Smart Agent receiver. The integration collects metrics from Couchbase servers.

```{note}
This monitor is not available on Windows as collectd plugins are only supported in Linux and Kubernetes. 
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to deploy the integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform.
2. Complete the [configuration](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/configure-the-collector.html#otel-configuration).

## Configuration

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector allows embedding a Smart Agent monitor configuration in an associated Smart Agent Receiver instance.

**Note:** Providing a Couchbase server monitor entry in your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration is required for its use. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
receivers:
    smartagent/couchbase:
        type: collectd/couchbase
        ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/couchbase` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file.

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: collectd/couchbase
   ...  # Additional config
```
