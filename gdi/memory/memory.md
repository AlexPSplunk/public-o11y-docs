# Memory usage
<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Memory monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector provides this integration as the `memory` monitor type for the Smart Agent Receiver. This monitor type sends memory usage stats for the underlying host. 

```{note}
This monitor is not available on Windows as collectd plugins are only supported in Linux and Kubernetes. 
```

On Linux hosts, this monitor type relies on the `/proc` file system. If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than `/proc`, set the path using the top-level configuration `procPath`, as shown in the following example:

```
procPath: /proc
monitors:
 - type: memory
```

## Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation-linux.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```
monitors:
  smartagent/collectd/memory: 
    type: collectd/memory
    ... # Additional config
```

To complete the integration, include the monitor type in a metrics pipeline. Add the monitor type to the `service/pipelines/metrics/receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/memory]
 ```     

To collect memory utilization metrics only, use the {ref}`host-metrics-receiver`.

## Metrics

The following metrics are available for this integration:

<div class="metrics-yaml" url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/main/pkg/monitors/collectd/memory/metadata.yaml"></div>

To emit metrics that are not default, you can add those metrics in the generic monitor-level `extraMetrics` configuration option. Metrics that are derived from specific configuration options that do not appear in the above list of metrics do not need to be added to `extraMetrics.`

To see a list of metrics that will be emitted, you can run `agent-status monitors` after configuring this monitor type in a running agent instance.
