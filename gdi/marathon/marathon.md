# Mesos Marathon
<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Marathon monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector provides this integration as the Mesos Marathon monitor type by using the Smart Agent Receiver.

Use this integration to monitor a Mesos Marathon instance using the [Marathon Python plugin](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent/blob/main/docs/monitors/collectd-marathon.md).

This monitor is available on Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.


## Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```
receivers:
  smartagent/marathon:
    type: collectd/marathon
    ... # Additional config
```

To complete the integration, include the Smart Agent receiver using this monitor in a metrics pipeline. To do this, add the receiver to the `service > pipelines > metrics > receivers` section of your configuration file.

```
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/marathon]
```

See <a href="https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">configuration examples</a> for specific use cases that show how the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector can integrate and complement existing environments.
