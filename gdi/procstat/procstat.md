<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the procstat monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the procstat monitor type for the Smart Agent Receiver.

Use this monitor to collect metrics about processes.

This integration is available for Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.

### Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```{note}
Provide a procstat monitor entry in your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.
```

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/procstat:
    type: telegraf/procstat
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/procstat` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/procstat]
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: telegraf/procstat
   ...  # Additional config
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

The following is an example procstat Smart Agent monitor configuration:

```yaml
procPath: /proc
monitors:
 - type: telegraf/procstat
   exe: "signalfx-agent*"
```   

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the procstat monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exe` | No | `string` | Name of an executable to monitor. For example, `exe: "signalfx-agent*"`. |
| `pattern` | No | `string` | Regular expression pattern to match against. |
| `user` | No | `string` | Username to match against. |
| `pidFile` | No | `string` | Path to pid file to monitor. For example, `pidFile: "/var/run/signalfx-agent.pid"`. |
| `processName` | No | `string` | Use to override the process name dimension. |
| `prefix` | No | `string` | Prefix to add to each dimension. |
| `pidTag` | No | `bool` | Whether to add PID as a dimension or as part of the metric name. The default value is `false`. |
| `cmdLineTag` | No | `bool` | When `true`, it adds the full `cmdline` as a dimension. The default value is `false`. |
| `cGroup` | No | `string` | The name of the cgroup to monitor. This cgroup name is appended to the configured `sysPath`. See the agent config schema for more information about the `sysPath` agent configuration. |
| `WinService` | No | `string` | The name of a Windows service to report procstat information on. |

On Linux hosts, this monitor relies on the `/proc` file system. If the underlying host's `/proc` file system is mounted somewhere other than `/proc`, specify the path using the top-level configuration `procPath`.

```{note}
The Smart Agent supports the `native` pid finder only. The `cgroup` and `systemd unit` options are not supported.
```
