      :description: Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Splunk APM exporter. See benefits, install, configuration, and traces

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector offers support for
the Splunk APM (SAPM) exporter. The SAPM exporter is in beta, but
breaking changes will not be introduced in a new release.

The SAPM exporter builds on the Jaeger protocol and adds additional
batching on top, which allows the Collector to export traces from
multiple nodes or services in a single batch. See `SAPM
protocol <https://github.com/signalfx/sapm-proto/>`__ for complete
details on the schema.

Review the Collectorâ€™s `security
documentation <https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/security.html>`__,
which contains recommendations on securing sensitive information such as
the API key required by this exporter.

.. note:: The SAPM exporter only collects trace data.

Installation
=====================

Follow these steps to deploy the integration:

1. Deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-linux`
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-windows`
   
   - :ref:`otel-install-k8s`

2. Configure the receiver as described in the next section.
3. Restart the Collector.

Configuration
=====================

Include the ``sapm`` exporter in the ``exporters`` section of your
configuration file, as shown in the following example:

.. code:: yaml

   exporters:
     sapm:
       access_token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
       access_token_passthrough: true
       endpoint: https://ingest.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com/v2/trace
       max_connections: 100
       num_workers: 8

   service:
     pipelines:
       # To complete the integration, include the exporter in a traces metrics pipeline. 
       traces:
           receivers: [nop]
           processors: [nop]
           exporters: [sapm]

Use the following extended example configuration to activate this
exporter in the Collector:

.. code:: yaml

   receivers:
     nop:

   processors:
     nop:

   exporters:
     sapm:
     sapm/customname:

       # Endpoint is the destination to where traces are sent in SAPM format.
       # The endpoint must be a full URL and include the scheme, port, and path. 
       # For example, ``https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v2/trace``
       endpoint: test-endpoint

       # AccessToken is the authentication token provided by Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.
       access_token: abcd1234

       # NumWorkers is the number of workers that should be used to export traces.
       # The exporter can make as many requests in parallel as the number of workers.
       num_workers: 3

       # MaxConnections is used to set a limit to the maximum idle HTTP connection the exporter can keep open.
       max_connections: 45

       access_token_passthrough: false
       # The option to use the ``com.splunk.signalfx.access_token`` trace resource attribute, if any, as the 
       # access  token. In either case, this attribute is deleted during final translation. Use this option 
       # with an identical configuration option for the SAPM receiver to preserve trace origin. The default 
       # value is ``true``

       timeout: 10s
       # The timeout for every attempt to send data to the back end.
       # The default value is ``5s``.
       sending_queue:
         enabled: true
         num_consumers: 2
         queue_size: 10
       retry_on_failure:
         enabled: true
         initial_interval: 10s
         max_interval: 60s
         max_elapsed_time: 10m

   service:
     pipelines:
       # To complete the integration, include the exporter in a traces metrics pipeline. 
       traces:
           receivers: [nop]
           processors: [nop]
           exporters: [sapm]

Configuration options
--------------------------------

The following table shows the configuration options:

.. raw:: html

   <div class="metrics-standard" category="included" url="hhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/splunk/collector-config-tools/main/cfg-metadata/receiver/sapm.yaml"></div>

Proxy support configuration
--------------------------------

The Collector provides proxy support for the SAPM exporter. Beyond the
standard YAML configuration, the SAPM exporter uses the net/http package
and the following proxy environment variables:

-  HTTP_PROXY
-  HTTPS_PROXY
-  NO_PROXY

Restart the Collector after adding these environment variables to your
configuration.
