# Splunk APM 

<meta name="Description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Splunk APM exporter. See benefits, install, configuration, and traces">

## Description 

The Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector offers support for the Splunk APM (SAPM) exporter. The SAPM exporter is in beta, but breaking changes will not be introduced in a new release.

The SAPM exporter builds on the Jaeger protocol and adds additional batching on top, which allows the Collector to export traces from multiple nodes or services in a single batch. See [SAPM protocol](https://github.com/signalfx/sapm-proto/) for complete details on the schema.

Review the Collector's [security documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/gdi/opentelemetry/security.html), which contains recommendations on securing sensitive information such as the API key required by this exporter.

> _**Note:**_ The SAPM exporter only collects trace data.

## Benefits

After you configure the integration, you can access these features:

- View metrics using the built-in dashboard. For information about dashboards, see [View dashboards in Observability Cloud](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/data-visualization/dashboards/view-dashboards.html#nav-View-dashboards).
- View a data-driven visualization of the physical servers, virtual machines, AWS instances, and other resources in your environment that are visible to Infrastructure Monitoring. For information about navigators, see [Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring navigators](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/infrastructure/navigators/navigators.html#nav-Splunk-Infrastructure-Monitoring-navigators).
- Access Metric Finder and search for metrics sent by the monitor. For information about Metric Finder, see [Use the Metric Finder](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/metrics-and-metadata/metrics-finder-metadata-catalog.html#use-the-metric-finder).

## Installation

Follow these steps to deploy this integration:  

1. Follow the steps to deploy the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector to your host or container platform:
   - {ref}`Install on Kubernetes <otel-install-k8s>`
   - {ref}`Install on Linux <otel-install-linux>`
   - {ref}`Install on Windows <otel-install-windows>`
2. Configure the exporter, as described in the Configuration section.
3. Restart the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Configuration

Include the `sapm` exporter in the ``exporters``section of your configuration file, as shown in the following example:

```yaml
exporters:
  sapm:
    access_token: YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
    access_token_passthrough: true
    endpoint: https://ingest.YOUR_SIGNALFX_REALM.signalfx.com/v2/trace
    max_connections: 100
    num_workers: 8

service:
  pipelines:
    # To complete the integration, include the exporter in a traces metrics pipeline. 
    traces:
        receivers: [nop]
        processors: [nop]
        exporters: [sapm]
```    

Use the following extended example configuration to activate this exporter in the Collector:

```yaml
receivers:
  nop:

processors:
  nop:

exporters:
  sapm:
  sapm/customname:

    # Endpoint is the destination to where traces are sent in SAPM format.
    # The endpoint must be a full URL and include the scheme, port, and path. 
    # For example, ``https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v2/trace``
    endpoint: test-endpoint

    # AccessToken is the authentication token provided by Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring.
    access_token: abcd1234

    # NumWorkers is the number of workers that should be used to export traces.
    # The exporter can make as many requests in parallel as the number of workers.
    num_workers: 3

    # MaxConnections is used to set a limit to the maximum idle HTTP connection the exporter can keep open.
    max_connections: 45

    access_token_passthrough: false
    # The option to use the ``com.splunk.signalfx.access_token`` trace resource attribute, if any, as the 
    # access  token. In either case, this attribute is deleted during final translation. Use this option 
    # with an identical configuration option for the SAPM receiver to preserve trace origin. The default 
    # value is ``true``

    timeout: 10s
    # The timeout for every attempt to send data to the back end.
    # The default value is ``5s``.
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      num_consumers: 2
      queue_size: 10
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true
      initial_interval: 10s
      max_interval: 60s
      max_elapsed_time: 10m

service:
  pipelines:
    # To complete the integration, include the exporter in a traces metrics pipeline. 
    traces:
        receivers: [nop]
        processors: [nop]
        exporters: [sapm]
```

### Configuration options

The following table shows the required and optional configuration options:

| Option | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|
| ``access_token`` | The authentication token provided by Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring or another backend that supports the SAPM protocol. See [Create and manage authentication tokens using Splunk Observability Cloud](https://docs.splunk.com/Observability/admin/authentication-tokens/tokens.html). There is no default value. | Yes |
| ``endpoint`` | The destination to where traces are sent in SAPM format. The endpoint must be a full URL and include the scheme, port, and path. For example, ``https://ingest.us0.signalfx.com/v2/trace``. The endpoint can be to the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring backend or to another data collection agent that has the SAPM receiver enabled. There is no default value. | Yes |
| ``max_connections`` | Used to set a limit to the maximum idle HTTP connection the exporter can keep open. The default value is ``100``. | No |
| ``num_workers`` | The number of workers that should be used to export traces. The exporter can make as many requests in parallel as the number of workers. Note that this option may be removed in a future release. The default value is ``8``. | No |
| ``access_token_passthrough`` | The option to use the ``com.splunk.signalfx.access_token`` trace resource attribute, if any, as the access token. In either case, this attribute is deleted during final translation. Use this option with an identical configuration option for the SAPM receiver to preserve trace origin. The default value is ``true``. | No |
| ``timeout`` | The timeout for every attempt to send data to the back end. The default value is ``5s``. | No |

### Proxy support configuration

The Collector provides proxy support for the SAPM exporter. Beyond the standard YAML configuration, the SAPM exporter uses the net/http package and the following proxy environment variables:

- HTTP_PROXY
- HTTPS_PROXY
- NO_PROXY

Restart the Collector after adding these environment variables to your configuration.
