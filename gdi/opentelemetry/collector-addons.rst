An Add-on is a type of app that runs on Splunk Observability Cloud and provides specific capabilities to other apps, such as getting data in, mapping data, or providing saved searches and macros. An add-on is a reusable component that supports other apps across a number of different use cases, and is not typically run as a standalone app.
