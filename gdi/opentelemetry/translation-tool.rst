      :description: Use this tool to convert a SignalFX Smart Agent YAML configuration file into the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector YAML configuration file.

``translatesfx`` is a command-line tool provided by Observability Cloud that helps you translate your existing Smart Agent YAML configuration file into a configuration that can be used by the Collector.  

.. note::

   With ``translatesfx`` you can automate most of the configuration changes when migrating from the Smart Agent to the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector. Evaluate and test any configuration produced by ``translatesfx`` carefully before releasing it into production environments.

There are two approaches to using ``translatesfx``, either from the command line or from the GUI.

From the command line
=====================================

To run the tool from the command line, download the executables from the :new-page:`releases page <https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector/releases>`. The executables are also contained in the RPM, MSI, and Debian packages as well as the Docker images (version 0.36.1 and higher).

The ``translatesfx`` command requires a Smart Agent configuration file as the first argument, and accepts a directory as the optional second argument, which is the working directory used by any Smart Agent `#from` file expansion directives. The ``translatesfx`` command uses this working directory to resolve any relative paths to files referenced by any `#from` directives at runtime.

.. code-block:: none

   % translatesfx <sfx-file> [<file expansion working directory>]

If this working directory argument is omitted, translatesfx expands relative file paths using the current working directory:

.. code-block:: none

   % translatesfx path/to/sfx/<config-filename>.yaml
   % translatesfx /etc/signalfx/sa-config.yaml

When translatesfx runs, it sends the translated Collector configuration to the standard output. To write the contents to disk, redirect this output to a new Collector configuration file:

.. code-block:: none

   % translatesfx /etc/signalfx/sa-config.yaml > /etc/signalfxotel-config.yaml

From the GUI
=====================================

#. Access the Smart Agent configuration converter at :new-page:`https://bossofopsando11y.com/configurator/saconverter <https://bossofopsando11y.com/configurator/saconverter>`. This tool is translatesfx with a GUI.
#. Paste your Smart Agent configuration in the :menuselection:`Smart Agent YAML` section of the GUI.

The corresponding translated Collector configuration file is populated in the OpenTelemetry YAML section.
