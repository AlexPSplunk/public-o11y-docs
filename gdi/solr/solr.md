## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the SolrCloud monitor type for the Smart Agent Receiver.

Use this integration to monitor Solr instances. You can collect metrics only when the instance is running in SolrCloud mode.

```{note}
This monitor is not available on Windows as collectd plugins are only supported in Linux and Kubernetes.

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml 
receivers:
  smartagent/solr:
    type: collectd/solr
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/solr` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/solr]
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
  - type: collectd/solr
    ...  # Additional config
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.
