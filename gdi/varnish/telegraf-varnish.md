# Telegraf Varnish
<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Telegraf Varnish monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

## Description

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `telegraf/varnish` monitor type using the Smart Agent Receiver. 

Use this integration to collect Varnish metrics.

This monitor is available on Kubernetes and Linux.

### Benefits

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

### Requirements 

This integration uses the `varnishstat` command. The Collector or Smart Agent must run on the same host as the Varnish server.

Run the following command to enable the Smart Agent to run the `varnishstat` command:

```bash
usermod -a -G varnish signalfx-agent
```

##  Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation-linux.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```{note}
Provide a Telegraf Varnish monitor entry in your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.
```

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/varnish:
    type: telegraf/varnish
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/varnish` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/varnish]
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
 - type: telegraf/varnish
   ...  # Additional config
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for this monitor:

| Option| Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `useSudo` | No | `bool` | If running as a restricted user, enable this flag to use `sudo`. The default value is `false`. |
| `binary` | No | `string` | The location of the `varnishstat` binary.  The default value is `/usr/bin/varnishstat`. |
| `stats` | No | `list of strings` | Which stats to gather. You can use glob matching. For example, `stats = ["MAIN.*"]`. The default value is `[MAIN.*]`. |
| `instanceName` | No | `string` | Optional name for the Varnish instance to query. The setting has the same effect of passing the `-n` parameter value. |
