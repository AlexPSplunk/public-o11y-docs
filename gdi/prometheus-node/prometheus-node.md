# Prometheus Node Exporter
<meta name="description" content="Use this Splunk Observability Cloud integration for the Prometheus Node Exporter monitor. See benefits, install, configuration, and metrics">

The {ref}`Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector <otel-intro>` provides this integration as the `prometheus/node` monitor type using the Smart Agent Receiver. 

## Description

Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for server level and OS level metrics, and measures various server resources such as RAM, disk space, and CPU utilization. Use the `prometheus/node` integration to collect Prometheus Node Exporter metrics and send them to Splunk Observability Cloud. This monitor is a wrapper around the {ref}`prometheus-exporter` monitor.

This integration is available for Kubernetes, Linux, and Windows.

### Benefits 

```{include} /_includes/benefits.md
```

## Installation

```{include} /_includes/collector-installation.md
```

## Configuration

```{include} /_includes/configuration.md
```

```{note}
Provide a prometheus/node monitor entry in your Collector or Smart Agent (deprecated) configuration. Use the appropriate form for your agent type.
```

### Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector

To activate this monitor in the Splunk Distribution of OpenTelemetry Collector, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
receivers:
  smartagent/prometheus-node:
    type: prometheus/node
    ...  # Additional config
```

To complete the monitor activation, you must also include the `smartagent/prometheus-node` receiver item in a `metrics` pipeline. To do this, add the receiver item to the `service` > `pipelines` > `metrics` > `receivers` section of your configuration file. For example:

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [smartagent/prometheus-node]
```

### Smart Agent

To activate this monitor in the Smart Agent, add the following to your agent configuration:

```yaml
monitors:  # All monitor config goes under this key
  - type: prometheus/node
    ...  # Additional config
```

See {ref}`smart-agent` for an autogenerated example of a YAML configuration file, with default values where applicable.

### Configuration settings

The following table shows the configuration options for the `prometheus/node` monitor:

| Option | Required | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `httpTimeout` | No | `int64` | HTTP timeout duration for both reads and writes. Must be a duration string accepted by `ParseDuration`. Default value is `10s`. |
| `username` | No | `string` | Username to use on each request. |
| `password` | No | `string` | Password to use on each request. |
| `useHTTPS` | No | `bool` | If true, the agent connects to the server using HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. Default value is `false`. |
| `httpHeaders` | No | `map of strings` | A map of HTTP header names to values. Comma-separated multiple values for the same message-header are supported. |
| `skipVerify` | No | `bool` | If both `useHTTPS` and `skipVerify` are `true`, the TLS certificate of the exporter is not verified. Default value is `false`. |
| `caCertPath` | No | `string` | Path to the CA certificate that has signed the TLS certificate, unnecessary if `skipVerify` is set to false. |
| `clientCertPath` | No | `string` | Path to the client TLS certificate to use for TLS required connections. |
| `clientKeyPath` | No | `string` | Path to the client TLS key to use for TLS required connections. |
| `host` | Yes | `string` | Host of the exporter. |
| `port` | Yes | `integer` | Port of the exporter. |
| `useServiceAccount` | No | `bool` | Use pod service account to authenticate. Default value is `false`. |
| `metricPath` | No | `string` | Path to the metrics endpoint on the exporter server. The default value is `/metrics`. |
| `sendAllMetrics` | No | `bool` | Send all the metrics that come out of the Prometheus exporter without any filtering. This option has No effect when using the Prometheus exporter monitor directly, since there is No built-in filtering. Default value is `false`. |
