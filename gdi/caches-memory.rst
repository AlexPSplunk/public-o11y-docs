.. note:: 

   The SignalFx Smart Agent has reached End of Support. While the agent can capture and export telemetry to Splunk Observability Cloud, Splunk no longer provides any support, feature updates, security, or bug fixes. Such requests are not bound by any SLAs.

   Smart Agent integrations and application receivers are available and supported through the Splunk Distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector. For more information, see :ref:`migration-monitors`. 

These application receivers gather metrics from their associated cache- and memory-related applications and the hosts the applications are running on.
