Validate your test configuration with try now 
******************************************************************************************

When you create a test, you have the option to validate the configuration of your test with the feature try now. There are two types of runs in Splunk Synthetic monitoring try now runs, and persisted runs. A try now run executes immediately and doesn't store any metrics. Try now runs are used to validate your test. A persisted run is executed on a schedule, metrics are stored, and are used for monitoring.
