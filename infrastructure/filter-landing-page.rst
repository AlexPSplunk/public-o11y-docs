    :description: Filter the data displayed by navigators on your Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring landing page

Any user can narrow the scope of data to be analyzed by applying one or more filters to the data sources on the Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring landing page.
On the Infrastructure Monitoring landing page, each card represents a navigator, corresponding to the services you monitor in Splunk Observability Cloud. A navigator card shows a count of instances in the population and highlights critical alerts linked to that population.
