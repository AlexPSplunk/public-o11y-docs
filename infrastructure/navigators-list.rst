    :description: Automated list of the navigators available to you

In Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring, a navigator is a collection of resources that lets you monitor metrics and logs across various instances of your services and detect outliers in the instance population based on key performance indicators. Resources in a navigator include, but are not limited to, a full list of entities, dashboards, related alerts and detectors, and service dependencies.

View all navigators
----------------------

To see all navigators, select :guilabel:`Infrastructure` from the Splunk Observability Cloud home page.

On the Infrastructure Monitoring landing page, each card represents a navigator, corresponding to the services you monitor in Splunk Observability Cloud. A navigator card shows a count of instances in the population and highlights critical alerts linked to that population.
