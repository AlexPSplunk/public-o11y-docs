    :description: Customize dashboards in navigators for Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring

.. note:: You need to be an admin to perform the tasks described in this topic.

Apart from modifying what content you view in a navigator as explained in :ref:`customize-navigator`, you can also as an admin  
use another level of navigator customization to make changes to the dashboards associated with a navigator. 

Use the :guilabel:`Manage navigator dashboards` option to find built-in or custom dashboards that you can add to the dashboard set for a navigator.

You access :guilabel:`Manage navigator dashboards` in either of the following ways:

- From the drop-down menu displayed when you click on the gear icon on the Infrastructure Navigabor home page

- From the ellipses button on the right side of a dashboard title ribbon.
