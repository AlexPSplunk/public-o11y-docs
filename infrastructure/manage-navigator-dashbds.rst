    :description: Customize dashboards in navigators for Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring

.. note:: You need to be an admin to perform the tasks explained in this topic.

Apart from modifying what content you view in a navigator as explained in :ref:`customize-navigator`, you can also as an admin  
use another level of navigator customization to make changes to the set of dashboards associated with a navigator. 

Use functionality accessed through the :guilabel:`Manage navigator dashboards` option to find built-in or custom dashboards that you can add to the dashboard set for a navigator.
