    :description: Examine service dependencies use case


The following use case features examples from Buttercup Games, a fictitious e-commerce company.

Kai, a site reliability engineer (SRE) at Buttercup Games, is responsible for rolling out an update to the ``checkoutservice`` application service in their Kubernetes environment. They want to make sure they know all the upstream and downstream dependencies of ``checkoutservice`` so they can notify the dependent teams.

Kai first checks their team's architecture diagram, but soon realizes it's outdated.

Kai then attempts to investigate service dependencies using the Network Explorer network map, which provides a complete graphical view of all services based on their network traffic, regardless of the languages and frameworks used in each service.

        :alt: This image shows the up-to-date architecture diagram for Kai's team. The diagram is an interactive network map in Network Explorer, which shows all upstream and downstream dependencies for ``checkoutservice``.

In particular, Kai selects ``checkoutservice`` to receive the update, and immediately gets a drilldown view of all upstream and downstream dependencies for ``checkoutservice``.

By exploring the Network Explorer network map, Kai successfully obtained the context they need to understand all the dependencies of the service being updated.
